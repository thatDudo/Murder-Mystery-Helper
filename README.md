# Murder Mystery Helper

A fabric mod for Hypixels Murder Mystery that does the detective work for you.

When playing on that server it will identify the murders through searching after a murder weapon in their hand.
After identification the mod will highlight the murders with a red glow and print a chat message **that is only visible to you**. If you are a murder, all the players will be highlighted to you with a white glow. Additional highlight options are to be found in the settings screen, which can be accessed by setting a key shortcut.

Please note that optifine shaders interfere with the minecraft glow effect, which this mod is making heavy use of.

The mod is not detectable but to not get banned you should stay discrete. Therefore: Please don't print the murders name in chat right away.
