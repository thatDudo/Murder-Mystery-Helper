# Murder Mystery Helper

A fabric mod for Hypixels Murder Mystery that does the detective work for you.

When playing on that server it will identify the murders by them equipping their murder weapon.
After identification the mod will highlight the murders with a red glow and print a chat message **that is only visible to you**.

If you are a murder, all the players will be highlighted to you with a white glow.

The mod is not detectable but to not get banned you should stay discrete. Therefore: Please don't print the murders name in chat right away.
