# Murder Mystery Helper

A fabric mod for Hypixels Murder Mystery that does the detective work for you.

When playing on the server it will identify the murders through searching for a murder weapon in their hand.
After identification the mod will highlight the murders with a red glow and print a chat message **that is only visible to you**. If you are a murder, all the players will be highlighted to you with a white glow. Further highlight options are available in the settings screen, which can be accessed through setting a key shortcut.

Please note that *Optifine* shaders interfere with the minecraft glow effect, which this mod is making heavy use of so using *Iris* instead is preferable.

The mod is not detectable but you should not consistently write the murders name to chat to avoid suspicions.
