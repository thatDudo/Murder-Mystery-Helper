# Murder Mystery Helper

A fabric mod for Hypixels Murder Mystery that does the detective work for you.

When playing on the server it will identify the murders through searching for a murder weapon in their hand.
After identification the mod will highlight the murders with a red glow and print a chat message *that is only visible to you*.

Please note that *Optifine* shaders interfere with the minecraft glow effect, so using *Iris* is preferable.

This mod is not detectable but you should obviously not consistently write the murders name to chat.
